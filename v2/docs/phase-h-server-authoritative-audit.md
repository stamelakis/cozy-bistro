# Phase H — Server-Authoritative Gap Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-08 (audit) · **Last updated:** 2026-06-09
**Goal:** Make the restaurant simulation run entirely on the server so it continues 24/7 even when no player is online. Client becomes a renderer + input forwarder.

---

## Phase 1 progress (2026-06-09) — non-bar tickets server-authoritative

**Done:**
- Server: `tick_ticket_state` cooking→ready now stamps pickup_x/z/floor from the assigned chef's position (no longer depends on the client's `finish_cooking` reducer call).
- Client: `StaffRouter.attachServerBridge()` — subscribes to `active_ticket` and `staff_actor` cloud changes. Reconciles local state. Two main cases:
  - **Chef-claim:** server writes `staff_actor.ticket_id` + target; bridge transitions local chef from idle → movingToWork.
  - **Chef-release:** server clears `staff_actor.ticket_id` (post-cooking) + sets target=home; bridge transitions local chef from working → returningHome.
- Wired from `Engine.bootGameAfterAuth`.
- Local deciders gated behind `serverOwnsTicketDispatch()` (true when `isServerSim("tickets")` + cloud connected):
  - `tickChef.idle` whole branch skipped — server's `auto_claim_queued_tickets` picks chef + station.
  - `tickChef.working` cook-completion skipped — server's `tick_ticket_state` flips cooking→ready.
  - `tickChef.returningHome` interrupt-claim skipped.
  - `tickWaiter.idle` ready-ticket pickup branches skipped (home + cross-floor) — server's `auto_assign_ready_tickets` picks waiter.
  - `tickWaiter.returningHome` interrupt-deliver skipped.
- Rollback path: `?serverSim=off` re-enables all local deciders.

**Still client-side (out of Phase 1 scope):**
- Bar-seat tickets (barman cook + serve dwell) — server has no equivalent. Gated `t.appliance !== "bar"` lets local barman handle the whole loop.
- Take-order trips (waiter walks to seated guest to take their order).
- Wash trips (waiter walks dirty plate to wash station).
- Guest in-meal state machine (seated → ordering → waiting → eating → leaving).
- Pantry/economy hot path, guest spawn, payment crediting.

**Pending verification:**
- Smoke test foreground play with the gating active. The server tick is 2 Hz (500 ms), so chef-claim now has up to ~500 ms latency between "ticket queued" and "chef walks to station." If it feels sluggish, bump `SIM_TICK_INTERVAL_MICROS` to 100_000 (10 Hz) — server cost is small per tick.

---

## Phase 2 progress (2026-06-09) — pantry server-authoritative

**Done (pantry):**
- Server: `place_order` reducer now calls `pantry_consume(rid, ingredients)` (same path the offline `auto_place_next_course` uses). Self-restocks via `try_restock_pantry` when stock is short — matches foreground client's `EconomySystem.shopForMissing` safety net.
- Client: `CookingSystem.consumeIngredients` skips its `bumpPantryStock(-1)` mirror when `isServerSim("tickets")` is on. Local pantry array still decrements (instant UI), but the server delta now comes from `place_order` itself instead of the parallel mirror, avoiding double-decrement.
- Compile clean (tsc + cargo wasm32); dev server boots clean.

**Skipped this session (payment):**
- Today's flow: client `creditCourse` → `economy.earnMoney(price)` → `syncCloudMoney` pushes an ABSOLUTE money value to `restaurant.cloud_money_cents` every few seconds.
- Server-authoritative payment requires flipping that loop: server credits `cloud_money_cents` per course delivered (delta), client subscribes to `cloud_money_cents` updates and reflects them in `economy.money`.
- That refactor needs: a new `credit_course_revenue` reducer, subscription handler on restaurant.cloud_money_cents, conversion of `syncCloudMoney` from absolute-write to no-op, reconciliation of the local economy state on subscribe. ~1-2 sessions on its own.

---

## Phase 3a progress (2026-06-09) — first guest transition server-authoritative

**Surprise:** the server's `tick_guest_state` already covers most of the in-meal transitions: `seated→ordering`, `ordering→waitingForFood`, `waitingForFood→eating`, `eating→next/leaving`, `wcWalking→wcSitting→wcWashing→seated`, plus `auto_place_next_course` on waitingForFood entry. Phase 3 is mostly client-side — strip parallel transitions and let the server drive.

**Done (this commit):**
- Client: `GuestSpawner.attachGuestServerBridge()` subscribes to `active_guest` cloud changes. On `waitingForFood→eating` transition the bridge fires `showPlateForGuest` + `sfx.chime` and drops the matching Ticket from the local queue (via `popDeliveredFor`).
- Client: `serverOwnsGuestStates()` helper (true when `isServerSim("guests")` + cloud connected).
- Client: local `case "waitingForFood"` handler gated behind the helper. The cloud bridge is now the only path to "eating" for this transition.
- Wired from Engine right after `hydrateFromCloud`.
- tsc + cargo clean; dev server boots without new errors.

**Still client-only (Phase 3b queue):**
- `eating → next course / leaving`: side effects `creditCourse`, `removePlateForGuest`, `orderIndex++`, `beginNextCourse` (intricate — reserves dish, mirrors tiers, consumes ingredients, enqueues new ticket). Bigger.
- `seated → ordering`: dwell + waiter take-order trip side effects.
- `ordering → waitingForFood`: ticket creation already covered server-side; local enqueueOrder still mirrors.
- WC trip transitions: `wcSitting → wcWashing → seated` (server already handles, client side effects need wiring).
- `walkingIn → seated`, `walkingToDoor`, `exitingDoor`, `walkingOut`: movement-driven, stays local.

---

## Phase 3b progress (2026-06-09) — final-course leaving server-authoritative

**Done:**
- Added `orderIndex` to `ActiveGuestRow` + the subscription row mapping + `listAllActiveGuests`.
- Bridge handles `eating → leaving` (server's final-course branch): fires `creditCourse`, `removePlateForGuest`, syncs `orderIndex` from cloud, runs `finalizeVisit`, sets `walkingToDoor` with path to the door.
- Local `case "eating"` handler gates the LEAVING branch only when `serverOwnsGuestStates()` + `finalCourse`. Multi-course meals (intermediate course advances) still run locally because the bridge doesn't cover `eating → next-course` yet.
- tsc clean; dev server boots.

---

## Phase 3c progress (2026-06-09) — multi-course eating advance server-authoritative

**Done:**
- Client: `StaffRouter.reconcileCloudTicket` now MATERIALIZES a local Ticket when the cloud row has a `srv-...` clientTempId (server-spawned) and `lookupLocalGuestId` resolves the guest. Without this, server-only tickets (from `auto_place_next_course`) had no local counterpart so `popDeliveredFor` couldn't find them.
- Client: `StaffRouter.lookupLocalGuestId` callback added; Engine wires it to `GuestSpawner.findLocalGuestIdByServerId`.
- Client: Bridge handles `eating → seated` (server's intermediate course advance): fires `creditCourse`, `removePlateForGuest`, syncs `orderIndex` from cloud, resets patience, reserves a clean dish locally (server doesn't simulate dishware pool yet) + mirrors reserved tiers. Skips local `enqueueOrder` since server's `auto_place_next_course` will fire when state hits `waitingForFood` again.
- Client: Local `case "eating"` handler now fully gated when server owns guest states (both branches).
- tsc clean; dev server boots.

---

## Phase 3d — explored, deferred (2026-06-09)

Both candidate transitions turned out to need work that crosses into Phase 4 (staff dispatch):

**WC trip transitions** (`wcWalking → wcSitting → wcWashing → seated`)
- Server state names differ from local (`wcSitting` ≠ `atToilet`, `wcWashing` ≠ `atSink`). There's already a `cloudStateToLocal` mapper, but the deeper problem is the SERVER collapses `atToilet → walkingToSink → atSink` into a single direct `wcSitting → wcWashing` transition (the comment at restaurant_sim.rs:3873 acknowledges this explicitly: "Walking back is a separate state in the client; here we collapse it").
- Honoring server's wcWashing while local is mid-walk to the sink requires either teleporting the guest (visual regression) or a different state-machine shape. Defer until the dishware / sink reservation logic also moves server-side.

**`seated → ordering` migration**
- Server's `try_dispatch_take_order` is gated `if owner_online { return }` (restaurant_sim.rs:2734) — only fires offline.
- Even if we drop the gate, the local `case "seated"` handler still needs to STOP doing local toilet finds + sink reservations + `enqueueOrderRequest` + `buildOrder` + `beginNextCourse`. Each piece has its own dependency on local-only state (`reservedToilets`, `reservedSinks`, local archetype/taste).
- Defer to Phase 4 alongside the waiter dispatch migration.

---

## Cumulative session progress (2026-06-09)

This session shipped:

| Phase | Subsystem | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Chef-claim + waiter-pickup (non-bar tickets) | ✓ server-authoritative |
| 2 | Pantry consumption | ✓ server-authoritative |
| 3a | `waitingForFood → eating` | ✓ server-authoritative |
| 3b | `eating → leaving` (final course) | ✓ server-authoritative |
| 3c | `eating → seated` (next course) + server-only ticket import | ✓ server-authoritative |

Rollback for any of these: `?serverSim=off` reverts to the local-decides-everything path.

**Remaining gaps (≈70% of the original audit):**
- Payment crediting (Phase 2b — needs `syncCloudMoney` absolute-write flipped to delta + subscription).
- WC trip transitions (state-machine shape mismatch).
- `seated → ordering` + waiter take-order dispatch (Phase 4).
- Bar-seat tickets (server has no barman cook+serve simulation).
- Wash trip dispatch (server has H.35 for offline, foreground still local).
- Errand-boy shopping trips.
- Pathfinding (or accept straight-line server-side — visit mode already does).
- Full client-side refactor to derive everything from subscriptions.

**Recommended next actions:**
1. **Publish + bake** what we have. The server-side change is reducer logic only (no schema changes), so this is a normal publish — no "BREAKING schema changes" warning expected.
2. **Smoke test live**: open a fresh restaurant, place an order, watch chef walk to station + cook + waiter deliver. Expect ~500 ms latency at each handoff (server tick interval). Multi-course meals should advance via server, ending with the leaving cascade.
3. **If sluggish:** consider bumping `SIM_TICK_INTERVAL_MICROS` from 500_000 → 100_000 (10 Hz). Server cost is small per tick.

---

## Phase 4 starter (2026-06-09) — waiter take-order server-authoritative

**Done:**
- Server: dropped the `if owner_online { return }` gate on `try_dispatch_take_order`. Server now dispatches take-order trips always-on (the bridge gating below ensures the client doesn't race).
- Client: added `takeOrderGuestId: bigint | null` to `StaffActorRow` + subscription mapping + `listStaffActors` + `listAllStaffActors`.
- Client: `StaffRouter.reconcileCloudStaffActor` extended with two new cases for waiters:
  - takeOrderGuestId null → set: find/fabricate matching local OrderRequest, attach to actor, transition idle → movingToWork toward seat.
  - takeOrderGuestId set → null: drop OrderRequest, transition working/movingToWork → returningHome.
- Client: local `tickWaiter.idle` (home + cross-floor order pickup) AND `tickWaiter.returningHome` (interrupt order pickup) gated behind `serverOwnsTicketDispatch()`.
- Published to dunnin: empty migration plan (reducer-only diff).

**Still client-side** (in the seated handler): when guest reaches "seated" the local sim calls `router.enqueueOrderRequest`. This creates the OrderRequest locally. With Phase 4 the server's `try_dispatch_take_order` picks it up via active_guest.state === "ordering" (server-side state). The local OrderRequest is now redundant for dispatch but still needed for the waiter's working-state dwell visual + the takeOrderCallback. Phase 4b can remove the local enqueueOrderRequest call entirely and have the bridge synthesize the OrderRequest from the cloud row.

**Still entirely client-side:**
- `buildOrder` (server has `build_server_order` for offline arrivals; foreground client's takeOrderCallback still uses local archetype/taste data).
- Bar-seat tickets.
- Wash trip dispatch (server has H.35 for offline only).
- Errand-boy shopping trips.
- Toilet/sink reservation logic on the seated WC trip.

---

## Phase 4b progress (2026-06-09) — order request + take-order callback server-driven

**Done (client-only — no server change):**
- Local `GuestSpawner` seated handler skips `router.enqueueOrderRequest` when `serverOwnsGuestStates()` AND the seat isn't a bar counter. Bar-seat OrderRequests still enqueue locally because the barman take-order path isn't server-side. Bridge synthesizes the non-bar OrderRequest from `staff_actor.takeOrderGuestId` when the server picks a waiter.
- Local `StaffRouter` waiter "working" branch skips the local `takeOrderCallback` fire when `serverOwnsTicketDispatch()`. Bridge's release case (take_order_guest_id → null) handles the trip completion via `returningHome`. Prevents double-enqueue: previously the local working dwell would fire `enqueueOrder` AND server's `auto_place_next_course` would also fire when the guest's state hit `waitingForFood`.

---

## Attempted Phase 4w (wash trip dispatch) — reverted

Tried dropping the `if owner_online { return }` gate on `try_dispatch_wash_trip`. Reverted: the bridge has no handler for `wash_target_uid` / `wash_phase` transitions, so dropping the gate would leave the server writing wash-trip state onto staff_actor rows while the local sim concurrently dispatched its own wash trips. Last-write-wins on the shared row would corrupt the waiter's state.

To do this safely needs:
- Bridge handler for `wash_target_uid` / `wash_phase` (similar shape to the chef-claim and take-order handlers).
- The local working-state completion (`washCallbacks.washOne` / `loadDishwasher`) still needs to fire because tick_wash_trip doesn't touch dishware_pool. Bridge would need to know `kind` + `stationDefId` to synthesize a local `WashTrip` object.
- Confirm `try_server_wash_load` and the bridge-driven trip don't double-process the same pieces.

Deferred — needs its own session.

---

## Cumulative session progress (2026-06-09) — final

This session shipped six migration phases:

| Phase | What's now server-authoritative |
|---|---|
| 1 | Chef-claim + waiter-pickup for non-bar tickets |
| 2 | Pantry consumption on `place_order` |
| 3a | Guest `waitingForFood → eating` |
| 3b | Guest `eating → leaving` (final course) |
| 3c | Guest `eating → seated` (next course) + server-only ticket materialization |
| 4  | Waiter take-order dispatch (`try_dispatch_take_order` always-on + bridge handler + gates) |
| 4b | Local `enqueueOrderRequest` + take-order callback gated (server fully owns ordering flow for non-bar) |

Rollback for any of these: `?serverSim=off`.

**Critical path coverage:** customer arrives → seated → server picks waiter for take-order → server enqueues ticket → server picks chef → server times cooking → server picks waiter for delivery → server flips guest to eating → server advances courses → server ends visit. ALL of that pipeline is now driven by the server's 2 Hz tick, with the client observing via subscription bridges and applying local visual side effects.

**What's still client-side (out of scope this session):**

| Subsystem | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Bar-seat tickets | Server's `tick_ticket_state` flips cooking → ready unconditionally + `auto_assign_ready_tickets` picks a waiter. Bar tickets need cooking → delivering directly (barman serves at the counter). Needs server schema/logic split. |
| Wash trip dispatch (foreground) | Bridge needs wash_target_uid handler + kind/stationDefId synthesis; tick_wash_trip is cosmetic-only (inventory in `try_server_wash_load`). See "Attempted Phase 4w" above. |
| Errand-boy shopping | Server has no errand simulation; would need to port `ErrandRouter` to Rust. |
| WC trip state transitions | Server collapses `atToilet → walkingToSink → atSink` to one state; local sim has movement states the server doesn't model. Honoring server's `wcWashing` while local mid-walk to sink would teleport guests. |
| `buildOrder` | Server has `build_server_order` for offline; foreground client's `auto_place_next_course` calls it server-side too. But local `creditCourse` still reads `g.order[g.orderIndex]` for the recipe price, so local g.order needs population. Parse `order_recipes` CSV from cloud → local g.order array. |
| Payment crediting | Today client absolute-writes cloud_money_cents via syncCloudMoney. Inverting to server-credits-via-delta + client-subscribes is a real refactor. |
| Pathfinder | Server uses straight-line + stair penalty; client uses A* through walls. Acceptable for v1; ~3-5 days to port. |

**Recommended order for next sessions:**
1. **Live verification** of what we shipped. Place orders, watch the kitchen pipeline. Confirm ~500 ms latency feels acceptable. If sluggish, bump `SIM_TICK_INTERVAL_MICROS` to 100_000 (10 Hz).
2. **Payment crediting flip** — most user-facing remaining piece. Needs careful syncCloudMoney + subscription work.
3. **`buildOrder` server-side** — currently the local takeOrderCallback path still wants to fire buildOrder. With Phase 4b gated, neither fires the order build, so order_recipes comes from server's `build_server_order`. Need local g.order populated from cloud's order_recipes CSV so local's `creditCourse` reads the right recipes.
4. **Wash trip dispatch** with full bridge.
5. **Bar-seat ticket split** server-side.

---

## Phase 5 — Errand-boy shopping trips (multi-session plan)

The full server port of `ErrandRouter` (666 lines, 9-phase state machine, queue management, pathfinding integration, visual offscreen simulation) is too big for a single contained slice. Splitting across ~4 sessions:

### Phase 5.1 — Schema additions (shipped this session)

Three additive columns on `staff_actor`, end-of-struct, non-destructive publish:

| Column | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `errand_phase` | `Option<String>` | `None` | One of `walkingToDoor` / `exitingDoor` / `walkingToRoadEdge` / `offscreen` / `walkingFromRoadEdge` / `enteringDoor` / `walkingToCounter` / `atCounter` / `returningHome`. Matches the local `ErrandState` enum verbatim. |
| `errand_trip_list_csv` | `Option<String>` | `None` | Frozen shopping list (`id:units` pairs) the helper is fetching. |
| `errand_offscreen_until_micros` | `i64` | `0` | Wall-clock timestamp when offscreen leg ends; advances flip to `walkingFromRoadEdge`. |

Constructor + re-register paths updated to initialize at idle defaults. Per H.93 safety rules.

### Phase 5.2 — Server shortage detector + dispatch reducer (next session)

- `try_dispatch_errand_trip(rid)`: scan errand helpers for an idle one. Scan `pantry_stock` for ingredients below threshold (mirrors `Game.dispatchAutoShop`). Pick list. Compute cost via `ingredient_cost` lookup. Charge `cloud_money_cents` saturating_sub (decide policy when balance insufficient — match foreground behavior).
- Set helper's `errand_phase = "walkingToDoor"`, `target = door interior pos`, freeze CSV on `errand_trip_list_csv`.
- Owner-online check: gate server detector on owner_offline initially; 5.4 drops the local detector and makes server the sole owner.

### Phase 5.3 — Per-phase tick state machine

- Extend `tick_staff_actor` to recognize `errand_phase` and advance through the 9 phases.
- Position interpolation toward target (door / road edge / counter / home).
- Offscreen phase: skip position; advance when `ctx.timestamp >= errand_offscreen_until_micros`.
- `atCounter` phase: parse CSV, add to `pantry_stock` via `bump_pantry_stock` deltas (matches `Game.completeErrandDelivery`).
- `returningHome` arrival: clear errand fields.

### Phase 5.4 — Bridge + gate local

- `StaffActorRow` surfaces `errandPhase` + `errandTripListCsv` + `errandOffscreenUntilMicros`.
- `ErrandRouter.attachServerBridge` subscribes; when `errand_phase` is set on a known helper, synthesize the local trip from the CSV + drive the visual via the existing `triggerRun` (or a new mirror entry point).
- Gate `Game.dispatchAutoShop` when `serverOwnsTicketDispatch()`. Server is the sole detector.
- Verify end-to-end: shortage triggers server dispatch, helper walks visibly, pantry refills, money debits.

### Estimated effort

- 5.2: 1 session.
- 5.3: 1-2 sessions.
- 5.4: 1 session.

Total: 3-4 sessions from here.

This doc maps what the server already does vs. what the local TS sim does. Each gap is sized so we know the real scope of the migration.

---

## TL;DR

The server is **30-40% there**. The local sim still owns most decision-making — chef claims, waiter dispatch, guest state transitions during a meal, WC timing, course advancement, etc. The server is mostly a passive mirror that picks up the slack only when the player is offline.

**Estimated effort to full server-authoritative:** ~10-20 focused workdays. The bulk is porting decision logic from TS to Rust + accepting that movement happens in straight lines on the server (or porting the pathfinder, which is itself ~3-5 days).

This is a real project, not a session.

---

## What the server already covers (✓ done)

### Tickets — `tick_ticket_state` ([restaurant_sim.rs:4666](../spacetime/src/reducers/restaurant_sim.rs))
- `cooking` → `ready` when state-clock reaches cook-seconds
- `delivered` → deleted after 1s dwell
- Releases the assigned chef on cooking completion (H.7)

### Staff actors — `tick_staff_actor` ([restaurant_sim.rs:3217](../spacetime/src/reducers/restaurant_sim.rs))
- Position interpolation toward target
- `movingToWork` → `working` on arrival (H.3)
- `returningHome` → `idle` on arrival
- Waiter delivery state machine (H.8): `movingToWork`→`working at pickup`→carry leg→`working at seat`→`returningHome`
- Take-order trip completion (H.34)
- Cross-floor handoff via target_floor

### Wash trips — `tick_wash_trip` ([restaurant_sim.rs:2894](../spacetime/src/reducers/restaurant_sim.rs))
- Dedicated multi-leg state machine for waiter wash trips
- Picks up dirty piece, walks to wash station, dwells, completes

### Guests — `tick_guest_state` ([restaurant_sim.rs:3457](../spacetime/src/reducers/restaurant_sim.rs))
- `leaving` dwell + delete cascade (also deletes orphan tickets, releases waiters)
- Patience timeout → kick to `leaving`
- Waiting-chair timeout (H.5)
- Seat fallback assignment (H.12) — picks closest free table when client hasn't
- WC trip target picking — toilet for `wcWalking`, sink for `wcSitting`→`wcWashing`
- Calls `settle_guest_dishes` + `accumulate_pending_visit_rollup` on despawn

### Dishware
- `tick_dishwasher_batch` — cycle countdown + flush
- `try_server_wash_load` — background wash dispatch
- `flush_one_dish` — clean pool increment

### Customer arrivals
- `try_server_spawn_guest` — continuous arrivals when owner offline (H.89)
- `try_spawn_arrival_guest` — seat-pre-assigned spawn (no ghosts)

### Long-running timers
- Recipe upgrade completions (H.43)
- Training completions (H.44)
- Salary deduction (H.45)
- Daily revenue / expense mirror (H.46)
- Rating history mirror (H.60)
- Day clock (`tick_day_clock`)

## Gaps — local TS sim still owns these (✗ to port)

### Tickets

| Transition | Where (client) | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Order placement (guest → kitchen) | `StaffRouter.enqueueOrder` (line 1281) | small — already a reducer mirror; just need server to be source |
| `queued` → `cooking` (chef claim) | `StaffRouter.tryClaimCookForChef` (line 2271) | **medium** — needs server-side chef selection (closest free chef on right floor, station picker, multipliers) |
| `ready` → `delivering` (waiter pickup) | `StaffRouter.tickWaiter` ticket pickup logic | medium — needs server-side waiter selection (nearest free waiter, claim race) |
| `delivering` → `delivered` (waiter arrives at seat) | `StaffRouter.tickWaiter` arrival branch | already partially covered by `tick_staff_actor` H.8, but needs verification |
| Stall recovery (chef gives up, returns to queue) | `StaffRouter.recoverStalledTickets` | small — port the time-based bounce |
| Cancel on guest leave | already cascaded in `tick_guest_state` despawn | ✓ covered |

### Guests — in-meal state machine

| Transition | Where (client) | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| `walkingIn` → `seated` (arrive at chair) | `GuestSpawner.tickGuest case "walkingIn"` (line 2707) | medium — straight-line movement OK, but need to detect arrival |
| `seated` → `ordering` (waiter starts taking order) | triggered by `StaffRouter.tickWaiter` matching them with a seated guest | medium — needs server-side waiter dispatch (next gap below) |
| `ordering` → `waitingForFood` (waiter finishes order-take dwell) | `StaffRouter` take-order completion fires `enqueueOrder` | small — happens at TAKE_ORDER_DWELL_MS already; just need server reducer chain |
| `waitingForFood` → `eating` (ticket delivered → start eating) | `GuestSpawner.popDeliveredFor` triggers state flip | small — server can flip when matching delivered ticket arrives |
| `eating` → next course (orderIndex++) | timer-based in `GuestSpawner.tickGuest case "eating"` (line 3033) | **medium** — server needs course logic + `beginNextCourse` equivalent (which itself involves `reserveOne` from dishware pool) |
| `eating` → `leaving` (final course done) | same `case "eating"` branch | small — once course state is on server |
| Patience-reset on course transitions | `GuestSpawner.beginNextCourse` resets to SERVE_PATIENCE | small |
| WC trip initiation (mid-meal interruption) | `GuestSpawner.maybeStartWcTrip` | small — already partial server logic, just needs the *trigger* |
| Course → `wcWalking` interrupt | `GuestSpawner` WC trip flow | small |
| `wcSitting` → `wcWashing` (auto-flip after dwell) | `GuestSpawner.tickGuest` WC branch | small |
| `wcWashing` → resume previous state | same | small |
| `walkingToWait` → `waiting` (arrive at overflow chair) | `GuestSpawner.tickGuest case "walkingToWait"` (line 2740) | medium |
| `seated` initialization (waiter's been notified) | `GuestSpawner.tickGuest` seated transition (line 2763) | medium |

### Staff dispatch — local TS sim drives chef/waiter/barman/errand decisions

| Logic | Where (client) | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Idle chef picks next queued ticket (per-floor preference, backlog fairness) | `StaffRouter.tryClaimCookForChef` chef-floor logic | **medium-large** — complex multi-criteria pick |
| Idle waiter picks: order-take vs. ticket-pickup vs. wash trip (priority order) | `StaffRouter.tickWaiter` idle dispatch | **medium-large** — priority is non-trivial |
| Barman picks bar tickets | `StaffRouter.tryClaimDrinkForBarman` | medium — chef variant for bar appliance |
| Errand-boy shopping trip dispatch | `ErrandRouter.tickErrand` (separate file) | medium — server already does the *transactions*; just needs the trip simulation |
| Wash-trip dispatch (pair best dirty with best station by total dist) | `StaffRouter.tryStartWashTrip` | medium-large — H.95 batch-pickup logic is non-trivial; server's `try_server_wash_load` is the offline analog but missing some logic |
| Cross-floor spill-over (chef on F0 takes F1 ticket when F1 chefs all busy) | `StaffRouter.pickChefForTicket` | small once base picker exists |
| Floor home assignment | `StaffSystem` (cloud-mirrored) | ✓ already mirrored |

### Pantry / ingredients

| Logic | Where (client) | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Decrement ingredients when ticket enters cooking | `CookingSystem.consumeIngredientsFor` | small — already partial server logic via `recipe_ingredients` table; just needs the trigger |
| Stock-out detection (ticket rejected if no ingredients) | `StaffRouter.enqueueOrder` check | small |
| Auto-shop trigger (when stock hits low threshold) | `AutoShop` system + `ErrandRouter` | ✓ H.41 covers offline; foreground still local |

### Economy / day clock

| Logic | Where (client) | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Income on ticket delivery → payment | `GuestSpawner.creditCourse` | medium — pricing involves taste/satisfaction math; server has *some* of this via `accumulate_pending_visit_rollup` but not the live foreground path |
| Expense on furniture purchase | `Game.buyFurniture` | ✓ already a reducer |
| Day advance | both client and server tick clocks | small |
| Rent deduction | `Game.rolloverDay` | small (already mirrored) |
| Boost button effect | `Game.activateBoost` (local-only) | small — port spawn-rate boost to server flag |

### Pathfinding

| Issue | Effort |
|---|---|
| Client uses `Pathfinder` for multi-floor routing through walls/doors | **large** — porting the pathfinder to Rust is ~3-5 days |
| Server currently uses straight-line + stair penalty | acceptable for first cut; characters will clip walls until pathfinder ports |

### Client-side rendering refactor

| Refactor | Effort |
|---|---|
| `GuestSpawner` becomes pure subscription consumer (no `this.guests` array) | **large** — ~3554 lines, many call sites |
| `StaffRouter` becomes pure subscription consumer (no `this.tickets`, `this.chefs[]`, etc.) | **large** — ~3113 lines, deeply integrated |
| `Game` removes the per-frame `update(dt)` calls that drive local sim | medium |
| Visualizers (already done in H.A/B) work with host's view too | small — just wire the existing visualizers into the main scene |

---

## Phased rollout plan

Sized so each phase is a 1-3 day commit and verifiable independently.

### Phase 1 — Ticket lifecycle (smallest, lowest risk)
Server takes over the chef-claim and waiter-pickup decisions. Local sim observes via subscription.
- Server: `tick_chef_dispatch` reducer that picks best chef for each queued ticket
- Server: `tick_waiter_pickup` for ready tickets
- Server: existing `tick_ticket_state` covers timer transitions
- Client: subscription handlers update local Ticket from cloud
- Effort: ~3 days

### Phase 2 — Pantry + economy on the server's hot path
Foreground play flows through server reducers for ingredient consumption and payment crediting (offline already works).
- Effort: ~1-2 days

### Phase 3 — Guest in-meal state machine
Port `tickGuest` state transitions for `seated`/`ordering`/`waitingForFood`/`eating`/course-advancement to Rust.
- Server: `tick_guest_meal` that handles all meal-phase transitions
- Client: pure subscription consumer for guest state
- Effort: ~3-4 days

### Phase 4 — Staff dispatch
Server picks who does what (which waiter takes which order, which waiter does which wash trip, etc.).
- Server: full chef + waiter + barman + errand dispatch in their `tick_*` functions
- Client: stops calling `cancelTicket`, `claimDirtyPickup`, etc.
- Effort: ~3-5 days

### Phase 5 — Pathfinding (or accept straight-line for v1)
Either port the multi-floor pathfinder to Rust or accept characters walking straight lines server-side (visit mode already does this; OK as a v1 trade-off).
- Effort: 0 (accept) or ~3-5 days (port)

### Phase 6 — Client refactor
Strip the local sim down to a thin subscription consumer + input forwarder. Delete `GuestSpawner.guests`, `StaffRouter.tickets`, etc.
- Effort: ~3 days

### Phase 7 — Verify continuous operation
Take a restaurant offline for a day, verify the server simulated it correctly (customers came, food was cooked, money was earned, dishes washed).
- Effort: ~1 day of monitoring + bug-fixing

**Total realistic estimate: 14-23 working days.**

## Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Server tick cost — 10Hz × N restaurants × all simulation work | profile early; throttle to 5Hz if needed; batch updates |
| Pathfinding desync (server straight-line vs. client smart paths) | accept v1; port pathfinder in v2 |
| Subscription bandwidth — high-frequency position updates | ✓ already throttled to 1Hz per actor today |
| Subtle state machine edge cases (cross-floor handoffs, course transitions) | each phase has its own test plan; verify against current local behavior |
| Latency on player actions | most actions are configuration (place furniture, hire) — accept |
| Save format compatibility | server is the save; localStorage becomes a presentation cache |

## What to commit to first

Phase 1 (ticket lifecycle) is the natural entry point:
- Smallest scope, contained blast radius
- Server already has most of the timer logic; just needs the dispatch decisions
- Verifiable: kitchen pipeline works end-to-end with the local sim stripped of its ticket array

Once Phase 1 ships and bakes for a session, move to Phase 2.

## Honest framing

This is a real refactor project, not a single session's worth of work. If we commit to it:
- Each phase is a separate commit, each shipped + verified before the next
- Roughly 2-3 weeks of focused work, depending on whether pathfinder is in scope
- Real regression risk per phase — each one moves authority

If the budget is "couple more sessions," we should pick a focused subset (e.g., Phase 1 only — server owns the ticket lifecycle, the rest stays local) and accept that we don't reach "server only for everything" in this push.

The choice is yours. The audit above is here so we can plan against reality, not estimates.
